            Bradypus tridactylus is distinct from other sloths because it has 
            no tail or external ears. They are of average size for sloth species,
            1 1/2 to 2 1/2 feet long and weighing between 5 and 12 pounds. They 
            live in rainforests from southern Central America to northeastern 
            Argentina. They are considered abundant in their native lands.
