            The southern two-toed sloth is also called Linnaeus' sloth after the species' 
            discoverer (Choloepus didactylus). These animals are covered in brown fur except 
            for their black faces. They reach lengths of about 2 to 2 1/2 feet and weigh roughly
            9 to 18 pounds. They hide almost motionless in the treetops of Central America and 
            northern South America, including portions of Brazil and Peru. Their tendency toward 
            lethargy keeps them safe from predators. </th></tr>
