            The maned three-toed sloth (Bradypus torquatus) is the second-rarest
            sloth species. These animals live only in Brazil and are considered 
            a vulnerable species by the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species.
            They're defined by the long black hair that runs from the back of their
            necks over their shoulders, which can grow as long as 15 inches. 
            They're about 1 1/2 to 2 feet long and weigh 8 to 10 pounds.
