            Choloepus hoffmanni is a hardy sloth species that lives in a wide variety 
            of habitats in Central and South America. Two distinct populations have 
            developed, one in the north -- in Colombia, western Ecuador and westernmost
            Venezuela -- and another in the south encompassing the area east of the Andes
            in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and western Brazil. Hoffmann's sloth is about 2 feet 
            long and weighs around 12 pounds. This species has a distinct pale face and a 
            protruding nose that resembles a pig's snout. </th></tr>
